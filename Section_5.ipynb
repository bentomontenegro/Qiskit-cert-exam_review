It is not intended, however, to furnish a complete preparation, but a guided overview with basic explanations and examples. The reader is encouraged to consult other sources and work on codes and examples as much as possible in order to prepare suitably."

    "# Section 5: Comparing and contrasting quantum information\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we review some basic concepts of quantum information theory and introduce their implementations in Qiskit.\n",

    "## 5.1 Using classical and quantum registers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1.1 Classical registers\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually in physics the term \"classical\" refers to theories that predate the discovery of quantum mechanics. Let us introduce the concept of a system in the context of classical information theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Def. 1__ *A system S is an abstraction of a physical device or a medium that can store information. We denote by $\\Sigma$* the set of all possible states of S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume from now on that $\\Sigma$ is always *discrete* and *nonempty*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important example of a classical system for us is perhaps a *classical bit*, where $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$. Their main purpose in quantum computing is to store the measurement results of quantum bits (see below), and we already know from §1.1 and §1.2 how to implement them in a quantum circuit."
