# Introduction to the topics of the Qiskit certification exam

This repository is intended to publicly share my personal review for the topics covered in the __IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X__ exam.

It's being developed alongside my own personal preparation and must not be considered a self-contained source for one's study. However, it may be useful as a quick guide for those who are new to such concepts and want to prepare suitably. I tried to be as clear and as brief as possible without loosing linearity and concision, giving examples and references when necessary. I also tried to present the contents in the same order denoted in the [exam's official webpage](https://www.ibm.com/training/certification/C0010300).

Soon I intend to try for a PR in [qiskit-community-tutorials](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-community-tutorials).

Any suggestions, PR's or comments are more than welcome.
