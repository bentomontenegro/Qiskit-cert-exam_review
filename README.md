# Qiskit-cert-exam_review

This repository is intended to publicly share my personal review of the topics covered in the exam IBM Certified Associate Developer - Quantum Computation using Qiskit v0.2X.

It is being developed alongside my own personal preparation and must not be considered a self-contained source for one's study. However, it may help others who may understand concepts the way I do and who may wish briefly review all the important topics of Qiskit.
